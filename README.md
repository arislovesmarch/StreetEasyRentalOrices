Hi!

This project aims to predict a Street Easy object's rental price given multiple feature values using (Multiple) Linear Regression and Random Forests with scikit-learn in a Jupyter Notebook with conda.

The following libraries are needed for the project:
- Pandas
- Matplot
- sklearn


All steps are explained using comments inside the code cells :)
